Guess My Number game where I explored the Ins and Outs of JavaScript. Day 1 of my 100 Days of Code challenge. Creating this game, I learned about DOM manipulation and manipulating CSS using JavaScript. 
Rules: type a number 1-20 in the input box and use the clues of "Too high" & "Too low" to guess the secret number in the box. You get 20 chances before losing the game.
